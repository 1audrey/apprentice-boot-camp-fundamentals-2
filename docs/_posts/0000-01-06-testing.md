# Why do we test?

Shout out your answers‚Ä¶

-[+] So we know when we are done
-[+] So we know we can make changes safely
-[+] To shorten our feedback loop

---

# Why test first?

Shout out your answers‚Ä¶

-[+] So that we don‚Äôt forget
-[+] So that we can‚Äôt write code that isn‚Äôt testable
-[+] Forces us to think about outcomes
  -[+] It focusses us

---

# Code isn‚Äôt always testable?

-[+] Testable code relies on good design
-[+] ‚ÄòCollaborators‚Äô need to be exposed
-[+] Results need to be predictable
-[+] Need to have granular access to produce useful failures

---

## Why don‚Äôt people test first?

Shout out your answers‚Ä¶

-[+] Code is hard to test
-[+] They are exploring
-[+] Lack of necessary skill set
  -[+] Might not be comfortable writing test without understanding implementation
-[+] Lack of appropriate motivation
-[+] No exposure to culture where testing seen as valuable
-[+] Code is disposable

---

# Unit tests

Unit of what?

-[+] One method?
-[+] One class?
-[+] One clump?
-[+] One piece of knowledge üëç

### Other levels of test are available

# Test Organisation

This matters

-[+] Tests should be cohesive
-[+] Tests should be clean
  -[+] Use arrange, act, assert as test case structure
  -[+] Make the test case talk
  -[+] Scenario should be limited to salient points

---

# Arrange, Act, Assert

```java
    @Test
    public void oneOfEach() {
        // Arrange
        Checkout checkout = new Checkout();
        checkout.scan("A");
        checkout.scan("B");
        checkout.scan("C");
        // Act
        String receipt = checkout.receipt();
        // Assert
        assertThat(receipt).containsSequence(
                "A: 50\n",
                "B: 30\n",
                "C: 20\n",
                "Total: 100");
    }
```

Note: Helps us to see what is being tested  
  From Bill Wake
  Matches with Specification By Example, Given, When, Then from Behaviour-Driven Development and Four Phase Test from Gerard Meszaros

## Noisy Test

```java
@Test
public void canFindHealthCheckLocation() {
  String clusterId = "cluster-id";
  String healthCheck = "/health-check";
  Environment environment = testEnvironment()
    .withRelease(release("release-id")
      .withStack(stack("stack-id")
        .withClusters(cluster(clusterId)
          .withType(type("test-type"))
          .withLabel("cluster-label")
          .withHealthCheck(healthCheck)))).build();

  assertThat(environment.healthCheckForCluster(clusterId))
    .isEqualTo(healthCheck);
}
```

---

## Clean(er) Test

```java
@Test
public void canFindHealthCheckLocation() {
  // Arrange
  String clusterId = "cluster-id";
  String healthCheck = "/health-check";
  Environment environment = testEnvironment()
    .withHealthCheckForCluster(healthCheck, clusterId).build();
  // Act
  HealthCheck healthCheckForCluster = 
    environment.healthCheckForCluster(clusterId);
  // Assert
  assertThat(healthCheckForCluster)
    .isEqualTo(healthCheck);
}
```

# Red, Green, Refactor

What does it mean?

-[+] Start by discussing what to test
-[+] Write enough test to make it fail meaningfully
-[+] Write just enough code to make it pass
-[+] Refactor

Note: Acknowledge we haven‚Äôt covered refactoring yet  

---

## Why Red, Green, Refactor?

-[+] Failing first means we know our test is working
-[+] Seeing a meaningful failure checks the test quality
-[+] Only writing enough code to make it pass ensures coverage
-[+] Refactoring means the design doesn‚Äôt degrade over time
-[+] Keeping the cycle short means we know why our test is failing
-[+] Also don‚Äôt have to maintain large contexts

Note: Explain meaningful failure  
  Good design doesn‚Äôt happen magically  
  Can only focus on a few things at once‚Äîcognitive load theory  

---

# Meaningless failure

```
java.lang.AssertionError
	at checkout.CheckoutTests.twoA(CheckoutTests.java:24)

Process finished with exit code 255
```

-[+] No knowledge expressed
-[+] Can‚Äôt see values being compared

Note: Ask what is wrong  

---

# Meaningful failure

```
org.junit.ComparisonFailure: [2 ‚ÄòA‚Äôs must cost 100] 
Expected :100
Actual   :130
 <Click to see difference>
 
 at checkout.CheckoutTests.twoA(CheckoutTests.java:24)

Process finished with exit code 255
```

-[+] Helpful message
-[+] Values displayed
-[+] Can see more detailed breakdown

### Exercise: [Bowling kata](http://codingdojo.org/kata/Bowling/) (1 hour)

In pairs, write code to calculate the ***total*** score for a valid sequence of rolls of American Ten-Pin Bowling. Don‚Äôt check for valid rolls, correct number of rolls/frames.

* 10 frames (usually two rolls in each)
* If a ***spare*** (all pins knocked over in two rolls), the value of the first roll of the next frame is doubled
  * In final frame, extend the frame by one bonus ball
* If a ***strike*** (all pins knocked over in one roll), frame finishes and value of the next frame is doubled
  * In final frame, extend the frame by two bonus balls

Note: Mentors to guide the TDD process

## Retro/stand-up

  * What was your first test?
  * What challenges did you discover?
  * Did following Red, Green, Refactor help?

Note: If there‚Äôs extra time‚Ä¶  
  Do the checkout kata with red green refactor (1 hour)
