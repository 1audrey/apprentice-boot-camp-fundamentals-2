### Exercise: [Bowling kata](http://codingdojo.org/kata/Bowling/)

In pairs, write code to calculate the ***total*** score for a valid sequence of rolls of American Ten-Pin Bowling. Don’t check for valid rolls, correct number of rolls/frames.

* 10 frames (usually two rolls in each)
* If a ***spare*** (all pins knocked over in two rolls), the value of the next roll is doubled
  * In final frame, extend the frame by one bonus ball
* If a ***strike*** (all pins knocked over in one roll), frame finishes and value of the next two rolls are doubled
  * In final frame, extend the frame by two bonus balls

Note: Mentors to guide the TDD process.  
  Write up some examples on a flip chart first to help them understand the bowling. They probably won’t get this far but you could cover the case of a triple strike in the last frame  
  Suggest they use a collection / varchar of numbers as the interface to their solution.

## Review

+ Bowling scoring is weird / hard
+ Strikes and spares are peculiar
+ Scoring involves time-travel
+ Game length varies

--

## Points to note

+ We will not check for valid rolls.
+ We will not check for correct number of rolls and frames.
+ We will not provide scores for intermediate frames.
+ Having some notion of a frame should make things easier...

Notes:
    Don't forget modelling techniques nouns and verbs etc.  
    Physical bowling pins  
    Scoring is hard it involves time-travel see http://codingdojo.org/kata/Bowling/ "Quote"

## Where do we start?

+ First we write a test
+ What should it be?

Notes:
    Canvas opinion from the audience.  

--

## The first test

```java
    int[] rolls = {0,0, 0,0, 0,0, 0,0, 0,0,
                   0,0, 0,0, 0,0, 0,0, 0,0,0};

    assertThat(game.score(rolls)).isEqualTo(0);

```

--

## What next?

+ _**Refactor?**_
+ Another test.
+ What should it be?

--

## The second test

```java
    int[] rolls = {1,1, 1,1, 1,1, 1,1, 1,1,
                   1,1, 1,1, 1,1, 1,1, 1,1,0};

    assertThat(game.score(rolls)).isEqualTo(20);
```

--

## What next?

+ _**Refactor**_
+ Another test.
+ What should it be?

--

## The third test

+ Test a single _spare_

--

## What next?

+ _**Refactor**_
+ Another test.
+ What should it be?

--

## Retro/stand-up

+ Who found it hard?
+ Was it hard to follow the Red/Green/Refactor cycle? Why?
+ How many tests did you write / how many cycles?
+ What was your first test?
+ Who wrote code without a failing test?
