<!--- ORGANISER THINGS TO CONSIDER 
- Which technical competencies, behaviours and knowledge module topics does the bootcamp cover/meet
- Structuring retros so that they can inform thinking for individual's personal learning records (off the job training record tab in their learning logs)
- Introducing some sort of test or quiz on basic concept learning points from the bootcamp to validate that they have taken stuff in, and provide organisation mentors with results to help them focus follow ups
--->

## Competencies, Behaviours and Knowledge units

* TC1 Logic: writes good quality code (logic) with sound syntax in at least one language 
* TC4 Test: can test code and analyse results to correct errors found using either V-model manual testing and/or using unit testing
* TC9 Development lifecycle: can operate at all stages of the software development lifecycle, with increasing breadth and depth over time with initial focus on build and 
* TC10 Can apply good practice approaches according to the relevant paradigm (for example object oriented, event driven or procedural)
* TC11 Can interpret and follow: software designs and functional/technical specifications, testing frameworks and methodologies, company defined ‘coding standards’ or industry good practice for coding, company/team/client approaches to continuous integration/source control

## Mentors / Languages
 
Two–three mentors required in addition to leads. These should be able to cover support for the required languages.

Several exercises (katas and code starters) will need to be ported to required languages.
